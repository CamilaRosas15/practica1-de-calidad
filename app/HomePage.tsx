        <p className="mb-4">This platform is designed for anyone applying for internships or jobs, especially in Singapore. It&apos;s for you if you&apos;ve ever wondered:</p>
        <ul className="mb-6 ml-4 space-y-2">
          <li>• How long does it usually take to get a response after applying?</li>
          <li>• What can I expect in Company X&apos;s Online Assessments?</li>
          <li>• Has anyone gone through Company X&apos;s interview process? What was it like?</li>
          <li>• Has anyone heard back from Company X after round X?</li>
          <li>• What are the current tech internship postings in Singapore?</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold">Default Job Filters</h4>
        <p className="mb-2">On the jobs page, the default filters have been set to:</p>
        <ul className="mb-4 ml-4 space-y-1">
          <li>• Country: Singapore</li>
          <li>• Job Type: Internship</li>

        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">
          If you&apos;re searching for roles in other countries, or for different job types such as Fresh Grad positions or fields like Product Management, you can easily adjust the filters to suit
          your preferences.

    question: "How do I track a new job application?",
    answer: `Simply click on any job posting and use the 'Track this job' button. If the job posting or company is not in our database, you can add it.\n
    By contributing, you can monitor the progress of your applications and compare your status with others applying for the same role.\n
    Our platform is community-driven, so we rely on contributions from users like you to keep our database up-to-date.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How do I figure out what interview rounds / types / questions were asked?",
    answer: `In the job posting page, there are 4 tabs: 
    Applied, Online Assessment, Interview Experience, and Questions.\n
    • "The 'Applied' tab shows the dates when other applicants submitted their applications and when they received their first response from the company (excluding automated replies).\n
    • The 'Online Assessment' tab shows interview experiences of applicants who have completed online assessments.\n
    • The 'Interview Experience' tab shows the detailed interview experiences of other applicants.\n
    • The 'Questions' tab allows you to ask and start discussions with others about that job posting.`,

  {
    question: "What kind of interview information can I share?",
    answer: `You can share interview rounds, types (technical, behavioral), LeetCode questions, and general experience.\n
    Please avoid sharing confidential or proprietary information.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know when do companies begin and end their hiring process?",
    answer: `Under each company's profile on our platform, the current job openings will be listed. \n
    You can report if the position have been closed and after we have verified, the end date will be that.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Have I been ghosted?",
    answer: `A good guideline is 1 - 2 weeks if there is no response. A lot of companies won't bother with rejection emails. \n
    If you suspect you've been ghosted, you can use our platform to check if others have received responses from the same employer. \n
    This information can help you decide whether to follow up with the employer or move on to other opportunities.`,
